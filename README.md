# Final Project
Your assignment for the final project is to rebuild this interface in the framework of your choice, using node package manager.

Simply take this existing code and rewrite it to produce the same output.

BUT...
You should also seek to improve it! 
How?
Think about what other information is available to you in the main search object, which in scripts.js is referred to as 'repos'. Would adding any of that info ehance your version?

Think about the current colour scheme. How does it make you feel? Would the app be more usable/approachable/friendly if it used different styles?

These are just EXAMPLES. You should try to come up with your own way to improve this dashboard at the same time as you are converting it to your framework.
